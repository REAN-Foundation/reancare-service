        "DetailedInformation": "Ejection fraction (EF) is a measurement, expressed as a percentage, of how much blood the left ventricle pumps out with each contraction.\nWhat’s normal? \n A normal heart’s ejection fraction may be between 50 and 70 percent. You can have a normal ejection fraction measurement and still have heart failure (called HFpEF or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction). If the heart muscle has become so thick and stiff that the ventricle holds a smaller than usual volume of blood, it might still seem to pump out a normal percentage of the blood that enters it. In reality, though, the total amount of blood pumped isn’t enough to meet your body’s needs.\nWhat’s too low? A ejection fraction measurement under 40 percent may be evidence of heart failure or cardiomyopathy. An EF from 41 to 49 percent may be considered “borderline.” It does not always indicate that a person is developing heart failure. Instead, it may indicate damage, perhaps from a previous heart attack. In severe cases, ejection fraction can be very low.\nWhat’s too high? An ejection fraction measurement higher than 75 percent may indicate a heart condition such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy",

        "DetailedInformation": "Heart failure means that the heart isn’t pumping as well as it should be.\nThe term “heart failure” makes it sound like the heart is no longer working at all and there’s nothing that can be done. Actually, heart failure means that the heart isn’t pumping as well as it should be. Congestive heart failure is a type of heart failure that requires seeking timely medical attention, although sometimes the two terms are used interchangeably.\nYour body depends on the heart’s pumping action to deliver oxygen- and nutrient-rich blood to the body’s cells. When the cells are nourished properly, the body can function normally. With heart failure, the weakened heart can’t supply the cells with enough blood. This results in fatigue and shortness of breath and some people have coughing. Everyday activities such as walking, climbing stairs or carrying groceries can become very difficult.",

        "DetailedInformation": "High blood pressure in the arteries that supply the lungs is called pulmonary hypertension (PH) or pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).\nThe blood pressure measured by a cuff on your arm isn't directly related to the pressure in your lungs. The blood vessels that supply the lungs constrict and their walls thicken, so they can't carry as much blood. As in a kinked garden hose, pressure builds up and backs up. The heart works harder, trying to force the blood through. If the pressure is high enough, eventually the heart can't keep up, and less blood can circulate through the lungs to pick up oxygen. Patients then become tired, dizzy and short of breath.\nIf a pre-existing disease triggered the PH, doctors call it secondary pulmonary hypertension. That's because it's secondary to another problem, such as a left heart or lung disorder. However, congenital heart disease can cause PH that's similar to PH when the cause isn't known, i.e., idiopathic or unexplained pulmonary arterial hypertension. In this case, the PAH is considered pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital heart disease, such as associated with a VSD or ASD (either repaired or unrepaired). The problem is due to scarring in the small arteries in the lung.",

        "DetailedInformation": "BMI is an indicator of the amount of body fat for most people. It is used as a screening tool to identify whether an adult is at a healthy weight.\nBMI stands for Body Mass Index: This is a numerical value of your weight in relation to your height. A BMI between 18.5 and 25 kg/m² indicates a normal weight. A BMI of less than 18.5 kg/m² is considered underweight. A BMI between 25 kg/m² and 29.9 kg/m² is considered overweight. A BMI of 30 kg/m² or higher is considered obese. Excess weight increases the heart's work.\nIt also raises blood pressure and blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels and lowers HDL (good) cholesterol levels. It can make diabetes more likely to develop, too. Lifestyle changes that help you maintain a 3-5% weight loss are likely to result in clinically meaningful improvements in blood glucose, triglycerides, and risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater weight loss can even help reduce BP and improve blood cholesterol.\nTo calculate your BMI: Type your height and weight into the online BMI calculator from NIH  (https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm).",
