### JOBS

 The PR workflow uses TWO jobs:
 
 #### CodeScan-ESLint
  In this job, we analyse the code developer wrote against some rules for stylistic or programmatic errors.
 
  * This job uses [Super-linter](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/super-linter) action to run this job. 
  * This job uses a static code analysis tool which identifies problematic patterns found in application source code.
 
 #### Build-Docker-Image
 In this job, we validate the Dockerfile and test the image build process to identify any issues incurred in the build process to recent code changes.
 
 * This job uses [docker/build-push-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-and-push-docker-images).  
 * This job create a docker image with image tag using branch name and short SHA of commit for example ```feature/test_5e38e33```



## Dev-CI-CD
Mode of trigger: ```Automated```

Dev Workflow is triggered automatically whenever any PR is merged into the develop branch. The workflow builds the applications and deploys the changes to the RF Platform Development environment.

### JOBS

#### Deploy-ECS
The Deploy ECS will be performing the following steps

* This job uses [docker/build-push-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-and-push-docker-images).
* This job uses 'dev' environment and login to ECR using creds and build a new ECR docker image with image tag using branch name and short SHA of commit for example ``` /reancare-service-dev-uat:develop_5e38e33 ```
* Then it will create new version of Amazon ECS task definition with new docker image and deploy Amazon ECS task definition using Duplo API.


## UAT-CI-CD
Mode of trigger: ```Automated```

There are two ways to use or trigger uat-CI-CD workflow
1. By creating a Pull Request to merge into MAIN branch
2. Whenever a Branch with prefix of 'release/' create a pull request

### JOBS

#### CodeScan-ESLint
The CodeScan ESLint will be performing the following steps.

* This job uses [Super-linter](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/super-linter) action to run this job.
* This job use static code analysis tool which identify problematic patterns found in application source code.

#### Label_Checks
The Label Checks will be performing the following steps.

* This job uses [pull-request-label-checker](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/label-checker-for-pull-requests).
* On event Pull Request this job will check wheter the Pull Request have one of major, minor , patch label or not. 

#### Deploy-ECS
The Deploy ECS will be performing the following steps.

* This job uses [docker/build-push-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-and-push-docker-images).
* This job uses 'UAT' environment and login to ECR using creds and build a new ECR docker image with image tag using branch name and short SHA of commit for example ``` /reancare-service-dev-uat:develop_5e38e33 ```. 
* Then it will create new version of Amazon ECS task definition with new docker image and deploy Amazon ECS task definition using Duplo API.


## PROD-CI-CD
Mode of trigger: ```Automated```

Prod Workflow is triggered automatically whenever any PR is merged into the main branch. The workflow builds the applications and deploys the changes to the RF Platform Production environment.

### JOBS

#### Publish-Release
The Publish-Release will be performing the following steps.

* This job uses [release-drafter](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter).
* This job will create a new GitHub release and the versioning will be based on what label developer gave for the pull request.

#### Deploy-ECS
The Deploy-ECS will be performing the following steps.

* This job uses [docker/build-push-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/build-and-push-docker-images).
* This job login to ECR using creds and build a new ECR docker image with image tag using ID of release whcih Publish-Release job created for example ``` reancare:97777323 ```.
* Then it will create new version of Amazon ECS task definition with new docker image and deploy Amazon ECS task definition using Duplo API.
